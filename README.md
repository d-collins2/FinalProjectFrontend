## Task Haven - Front End

This React web app was designed to be the responsive front-end for my final project at Flatiron School. It is designed to be my take on the popular web based list making application, Trello, which gives you a visual representation of a project you are working on.

## Libraries & Middleware

Task Haven was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and comes with the dependencies therein. [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) is used for state management, and the file structure is arranged accordingly; see below. [React Materialize](https://github.com/react-materialize/react-materialize) manages a big chunk of the display. [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) is used to help with functionality when organizing your own boards. [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) handles component rendering and navigation based on the URL/browse history.

## Installation 

To get started with Task Haven, fork this repository and clone it to your hard drive. CD into the folder and run ```npm install```. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run ```npm start``` to get your app running. For more information about how the back-end is structured, visit [this](https://github.com/d-collins2/Trello-Backend) repository.

## Structure

The top-level folder of Task Haven includes a `public` folder, which holds the `index.html` file where the app is officially rendered by React, an `src` folder which holds the application itself, a `design` folder which holds [Semantic UI's](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) functionality, and then a few other files: .gitignore, README, and package.json. 

The `src` folder includes five main folders: `redux`, handles the Redux logic responsible for the app's state management, `containers`, which organizes the top-level components which display lower-level components,  `components`, which organizes the bulk of the app's logic and content which needs to be rendered in their specific containers, `forms`, which organizes the form logic and information which will be submitted to the backend of the app, `index.js` handles how the app is mounted into the `index.html` file in the top-level folder. 

## Containers
My app is composed of 4 main container components with several lower-leveled components attached to them: 

### BoardPage 

This container is responsible for the main functionality of the app. It is used to render the many `ListContainer.js` associated with the board chosen. The `ListContainer.js` associated with the board is rendered and shows the corresponding `List.js` components which render its `Task.js` and allow for the drag and drop actions to occcur.

### HomePageUser 

This container is responsible for the homepage which is seen on login. It renders the users associated `BoardContainer.js` and `RightToolBar.js`. The `BoardContainer` is used to render the users boards which are created through the component `board.js`. 


### TeamPage 

This container is responsible for displaying the teams associated boards, team members and a settings tab. The boards tab containes the `TeamBoardContainer.js`, which is responsible for rendering boards associated with the current team being displayed.

### UserProfile

This container is responsible for displaying the user associated boards, teams and a settings tab. The boards tab containes the `BoardContainer.js`, which is responsible for rendering boards associated with the current user being displayed.

## User Accounts 

User authentication is done through a token which is created upon sign up and will be checked upon login. You can learn more about this process and how it is structured [here](https://github.com/d-collins2/Task-Haven-Backend) in the back-end repository. Upon verification a user is allowed to create a team, see their current boards, utilize any board they're apart of and make changes to those boards. 

## Future Developments 

### Instant Notification of Changes To A Board 

At the moment, any changes to the board are shown in the activites section on the side nav in each board. These change are only seen on refresh. I'd like to add action cables to allow for each user apart of a team to know when changes occur on any board they are apart of.
